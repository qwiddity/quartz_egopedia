The overly wordy title is what appeared in my mind along with the original idea for the tool now located at  [Gene Keys Clocks](https://geneclock.deflexion.org).  Using this tool you can calculate Full Emotional Spectrum profiles for any set Gene Keys which can generated by any [Hologenetic Profile](https://genekeys.com/free-profile/) (but not limited to profiles any combination keys/programming partners can be generated). 

The [Gene Keys Clocks](https://geneclock.deflexion.org) tool also exposes other information for each Gene Key (also available in the [Living Library](https://genekeys.com/living-library/), but is much faster for developing a large number of keywords quickly, which we will need for the following task to assist in targeting our contemplations to suit our emotions.

To calculate a *Personalised Spectrum of Consciousness*, clocks  in  your Golden Path order, dialing each clock to the appropriate key, adding new clocks where necessary by pressing the "Add Clock" button. You can go beyond your profile and add as many clocks as you like.

Turn the clock to the appropriate Gene Key, and above each clock will be displayed the currently selected **Key #**, as well as the **Opposing Key #** (this is not a relationship described in *The Gene Keys*, it is just the directly opposing key number when they are displayed as a circular metaphor like a calendar with The Gene Keys, I Ching Hexagrams, and Zodiac signs, seasons, are all able to be integrated into this *cosmic horizon metaphor*).
