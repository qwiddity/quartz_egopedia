## Introduction

Welcome to Gene Keys 3D, an interactive web-based 3D visualisation engine for exploring  [The Gene Keys](https;://genekeys.com)(https;://genekeys.com), and creating personalised contemplation and emotional spectral profiles. 
This guide will walk you through the functionalities and how to interact with the viewport using your keyboard and mouse (better touch support for mobile devices is planned)
Enjoy your journey!
### Initial Behaviour

Upon loading the page, you'll see a 3D viewport displaying spheres representing gene keys. By default, the spheres will arrange themselves in a "Spiral Disc" formation. The viewport will automatically cycle through different arrangements every 5 seconds, and starts out like this, showing a single sphere for Gene Key 1:

## Viewport Interaction

### Mouse Controls

- **Rotate**: Left-click and drag to rotate the camera around the center of the viewport.
- **Zoom**: Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
- **Pan**: Right-click and drag to pan the camera.

### Keyboard Controls

- **Stop Cycling**: Any key press will stop the automatic cycling of arrangements.
- **Keyboard input:** Planned for future experiments.

## Control Panel

Located on the left side of the viewport, the Control Panel offers various options to customize your experience.

## Arrangement Selector Drop-down: Detailed Overview

### Spiral Disc

The "Spiral Disc" arrangement is the default setting when you first load the Gene Keys 3D application. This arrangement is selected because it offers a disorganized, random distribution pattern that can be easily created with 8 groups of 8 spheres, totaling 64. The layout is designed to give a sense of randomness while still maintaining a visually pleasing pattern.

### Sheet

The "Sheet" arrangement lays out the spheres in a flat, grid-like formation. This is a straightforward layout that allows for easy observation of all spheres simultaneously. From a biology course years ago I seem to remember something about our nervous system beginning as a strip of cells which then divides into a sheet, which is then folded into tubes. This arrangement is the simplest, most tightly-packed formation of spheres allowable in biology (because cubic arrangements are not possible at this stage of development).

### Methylated DNA

The "Methylated DNA" arrangement is designed to resemble the structure of DNA when it is methylated. In this state, the DNA is tightly wrapped around histone proteins, which are represented by the spheres in this view. Methylation typically serves as a marker for gene silencing and is crucial for cellular differentiation. This view aims to give a visual representation of how DNA may appear in its methylated state, by presenting the Gene Keys as the *histone proteins* around which the actual DNA is wrapped to better protect it from radiation damage.

### Transcribed DNA

The "Transcribed DNA" arrangement aims to represent DNA during the process of transcription. Transcription is the first step in gene expression, where a specific segment of DNA is used as a template to synthesize a complementary RNA molecule. This RNA molecule then serves as a template for protein synthesis. In this view, the spheres are arranged to mimic the *histone proteins* letting the helical structure of DNA unwind around them to be read by the transcription machinery (*ribosomes*).

### Cycling

The "Cycling" option will automatically cycle through all the above arrangements every 5 seconds. This is useful for getting a quick overview of all the different ways the spheres can be arranged. You can select the visibility of whichever keys you would like to see in the visualisation for any other arrangement, then re-select "Cycling" and the keys you have selected will then cycle through all the arrangements.

## Group Visibility Toggles: Detailed Overview

**Group Gene Key Toggles**: Below the Arrangement selector there are "Group #" checkboxes numbered 1-8. Toggling these will change visibility for each group of Gene Keys. There are 8 groups of 8 keys, beginning with 1-8 and ending with 56-64.

### List of Codon Rings with Gene Key Numbers

**Codon Ring Toggles**: Each Codon Ring has a checkbox next to its name. Checking or unchecking this box will toggle the visibility of all Gene Keys associated with that Codon Ring as listed:

- **Alchemy**: (6, 40, 47, 64)
- **Destiny**: (34, 43)
- **Divinity**: (22, 36, 37, 63)
- **Fire**: (1, 14)
- **Gaia**: (19, 60, 61)
- **Humanity**: (10, 17, 21, 25, 38, 51)
- **Illuminati**: (44, 50)
- **Illusion**: (28, 32)
- **Life & Death**: (3, 20, 23, 24, 27, 42)
- **Light**: (5, 9, 11, 26)
- **Matter**: (18, 46, 48, 57)
- **Miracles**: (35)
- **No Return**: (31, 62)
- **Origin**: (41)
- **Prosperity**: (16, 45)
- **Purification**: (13, 30)
- **Secrets**: (12)
- **Seeking**: (15, 39, 52, 53, 54, 58)
- **Trials**: (12, 33, 56)
- **Union**: (4, 7, 29, 59)
- **Water**: (2, 8)
- **Whirlwind**: (49, 55)

 
**Individual Sphere Toggles**: Below the toggles for the Codon Rings there are a set of 8 collapsible menus, containing checkboxes for individual spheres. These allow you to toggle the visibility for each sphere.

## Hover Panel

Hovering over a sphere will display additional information about the Gene Key in a panel on the right side of the viewport.

## Readout Panel

Located at the bottom of the viewport, underneath the Hover Panel the Readout Panel provides  information about the currently selected Gene Key.
