# Gene Keys 3D User Guide üë©‚Äçüè´üß¨

## Introduction

Welcome to Gene Keys 3D, an interactive web-based 3D visualisation engine for exploring *The Gene Keys* (https://genekeys.com). The project aims to assist your contemplation as a performant, smartphone-to-projector capable extension to *Living Library*. It can perform visual computations and create personalised emotional spectral profiles (see [an example](https://geneclock.deflexion.org/AlbertEinstein.html) made using an iconic scientist's Hologenetic Profile)

This guide will walk you through the functionalities and how to interact with the viewport using your keyboard and mouse (touch support here, but may be limited on some platforms)

Enjoy your journey!

### Initial Behaviour

Upon loading the page, you'll see a 3D viewport displaying spheres representing gene keys. By default, the spheres will arrange themselves in a "Spiral Disc" formation. The viewport will automatically cycle through different arrangements every 5 seconds, and starts out like this, showing a single sphere for Gene Key 1:

## Viewport Interaction

### Mouse Controls

- **Rotate**: Left-click and drag to rotate the camera around the center of the viewport.
- **Zoom**: Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
- **Pan**: Right-click and drag to pan the camera.

### Keyboard Controls

- **Stop Cycling**: Any key press will stop the automatic cycling of arrangements.
- **Keyboard input:** Planned for future experiments.

# Key Visibility Control Panel [üß¨]

Located on the left side of the viewport, the Control Panel offers various options to customize your experience. Opened when the page loads, close and open it by clicking on the üß¨button.

## Arrangement Selector Drop-down: Detailed Overview

### Spiral Disc

The "Spiral Disc" arrangement is the default setting when you first load the Gene Keys 3D application. This arrangement is selected because it offers a disorganized, random distribution pattern that can be easily created with 8 groups of 8 spheres, totaling 64. The layout is designed to give a sense of randomness while still maintaining a visually pleasing pattern.

### Sheet

The "Sheet" arrangement lays out the spheres in a flat, grid-like formation. This is a straightforward layout that allows for easy observation of all spheres simultaneously. From a biology course years ago I seem to remember something about our nervous system beginning as a strip of cells which then divides into a sheet, which is then folded into tubes. This arrangement is the simplest, most tightly-packed formation of spheres allowable in biology (because cubic arrangements are not possible at this stage of development).

### Methylated DNA

The "Methylated DNA" arrangement is designed to resemble the structure of DNA when it is methylated. In this state, the DNA is tightly wrapped around histone proteins, which are represented by the spheres in this view. Methylation typically serves as a marker for gene silencing and is crucial for cellular differentiation. This view aims to give a visual representation of how DNA may appear in its methylated state, by presenting the Gene Keys as the *histone proteins* around which the actual DNA is wrapped to better protect it from radiation damage.

### Transcribed DNA

The "Transcribed DNA" arrangement aims to represent DNA during the process of transcription. Transcription is the first step in gene expression, where a specific segment of DNA is used as a template to synthesize a complementary RNA molecule. This RNA molecule then serves as a template for protein synthesis. In this view, the spheres are arranged to mimic the *histone proteins* letting the helical structure of DNA unwind around them to be read by the transcription machinery (*ribosomes*).

### Cycling Mode

The "Cycling " option will automatically cycle through all the above arrangements every 5 seconds. This is useful for getting a quick overview of all the different ways the spheres can be arranged. You can select the visibility of whichever keys you would like to see in the visualisation for any other arrangement, then re-select "Cycling" and the keys you have selected will then cycle through all the arrangements.

## Codon Ring Visibility Toggles

### List of Codon Rings by Name
**Codon Ring Toggles**: Each Codon Ring has a checkbox next to its name. Checking or unchecking this box will toggle the visibility of all Gene Keys associated with that Codon Ring as listed:

### Gene Key Numbers & Groups 1-8
**Individual Sphere Toggles**: Below the toggles for the Codon Rings there are a set of 8 collapsible menus, containing checkboxes for individual spheres. These allow you to toggle the visibility for each sphere. Also, there are "Group #" checkboxes numbered 1-8. Toggling these will change visibility for each group of Gene Keys. There are 8 groups of 8 keys, beginning with 1-8 and ending with 56-64.

# Key Information Panel (on hover)
Hovering over a sphere will display information about that Gene Key in a panel at the top of the viewport. The text is selectable and colour-coded.

## Hover Hexagram Panel
This displays an image at the *top-right* of the viewport - the hexagram currently being hovered over by the mouse or touch input. You can drag it wherever you wish (touch support limited, also the mouse may drop the panel if dragged over a sphere - it will pick it up again by mousing over if you do not click) and click to set it down.

# Readout Information Panel (on click)
Clicking on a sphere will display information about that Gene Key in a panel at the bottom of the viewport. The text is selectable and colour-coded.

## Hover Hexagram Panel
This displays an image at the *bottom-left* of the viewport - the last hexagram selected by mouse or touch input. You can drag the image wherever you wish (touch support limited). When you select another sphere, a new hexagram will spawn into this location, allowing you create as many as you wish.

# Drawing Tools Panel [üñå]

Pressing the üñåÔ∏è button will open and close the drawing tools panel, which will also pause the animation if there is one engaged. The panel contains some simple tools for drawing on a canvas, like a transparent digital whiteboard above the spheres. üë©‚Äçüè´ This can be used to visually demonstrate key relationships and other hexagram information, or just for taking notes.

### üÖ∞Ô∏èText Tool
Toggle-selectable tool for typing on the canvas, use the colour-picker to choose your style.

### ‚úèÔ∏èFree Line Drawing Tool
Toggle-selectable tool for free-handing on the canvas, use the colour-picker to select your tone.

### üìèStraight-Line Drawing Tool
Toggle-selectable tool for drawing straight lines on the canvas, free with some included weird behaviour, use the colour-picker to test your might. To use, select one location (such as a sphere), then select another location as the endpoint for your straight line.

### üìê, ‚≠ï, ‚óºÔ∏è Shape-Drawing Tools
These do work, but not really as expected, so expect some unexpected behaviour trying to switch away from these particular tools, and you'll meet with expectations.

### Line Thickness / Font Size Scrollbar
This does what you'd expect from a scrollbar used to make things smaller or bigger. Try it out!

### üóëÔ∏è Delete Tool
Deletes everything on the canvas. Start afresh.

### üßº Eraser Tool
Need to detail away the last imperfections from your masterpiece? Try this...

This is an example of a visual contemplation of the human genome, linking all the programming partnerships when the keys are contemplated in a circle. It definitely required use of the eraser tool, and shows how there is only ONE crosslinked pair (7+13, 8+14) in the lower-right quadrant. But if the image is not enough, you can use Gene Keys 3D to create maps of your own contemplations, in colours of your choiceüòä

To return to the Initial behaviour, just reload the page. If you prefer a white background on a dark image, inverting the fanciest of [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) filters currently produces best results!üòÑ

I hope you have fun exploring and contemplating with Gene Keys 3D, which is very much a prototype in development. If you'd like to support me in creating this and other projects, please:
